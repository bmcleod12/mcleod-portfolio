## Description
This Horiseon Social Solution Services webpage includes semantic HTML tags and in-page links. It started as a homework assignment to refactor code for accessibility standards.

## Installation

With this being a project with starter code, the files and folders were already set up to work including:
* index.html file with the HTML code
* assets folder with a css folder and images folder
* Within the assets folder is a style.css file, called upon by index.html
* Within the images folder are all of the graphics and icons used in the webpage

## Usage 

Open the webpage to learn more about Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc: https://bmcleod12.github.io/horiseon-webpage/

The top half of the page provides a navigation bar with in-page links to sections below and an intro image:

<img alt="Top half of the page" src="assets/images/Horiseon-top-section.png"/>

The bottom half of the page provides sections with information on Horiseon's offerings and a side panel with supplemental information, as well as a footer:

## Tests and Known Issues

Test 1:
With the page open, click each link in the navigation bar at the top left of the screen and confirm the site switches to the appropriate page. Confirm the page clicked in the menu remains lit up (active).

Test 2:
Open the page in different browsers to confirm each element of the page renders as expected.

Known Issue:
In any browser, when the page is resized to a certain width, the side panel is wrapped underneath the main sections.

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement image enlargement (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/)
2. Update the Submit button on the Contact page to be functional
3. Swap placeholder portfolio elements with real code examples
